# Devkota Consultancy: Chemical Engineering Design Consultancy Comapny

This website was created for the 1st Milestone Project at the Code Institute's Diploma course in Software Development.

The aim of the website was to create a chemical engineering design consutlancy company, based in the UK, that focuses on the FEED (Front End Engineering Design) aspect of consultancy. In order to make the website seem and feel real, I've created a nice and wide intial landing page to welcome the user, with 3 additional sections to add depth into the website. Within the footer section, I've added the comapny's social media profiles so the user can keep up-to-date with the company. Adding a social aspect to the website also builds trust and bonding with the user.
