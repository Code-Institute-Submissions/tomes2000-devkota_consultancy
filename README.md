# Devkota Consultancy: Chemical Engineering Design Consultancy Comapny

This website was created for the 1st Milestone Project at the Code Institute's Diploma course in Software Development.

The aim of the website was to create a chemical engineering design consutlancy company, based in the UK, that focuses on the FEED (Front End Engineering Design) aspect of consultancy. In order to make the website seem and feel real, I've created a nice and wide intial landing page to welcome the user, with 3 additional sections to add depth into the website. Within the footer section, I've added the comapny's social media profiles so the user can keep up-to-date with the company. Adding a social aspect to the website also builds trust and bonding with the user.

# UX and UI
* ## Project Information
  Having completed a BEng in Chemical Engineering that focuses on the FEED (Front End Engineering Design) aspect of chemical engineering, I have a good understanding on this subject matter and what services are required in order to set up a chemical engineering plant within the UK.

     * ## Typography
     In order to make the logo bold, I went with Franklin Gothic Medium, For the landing text, I wanted to make it look opulent therefore I went with the Italiana          font. The bold logo at the top and the finely-put-together landing text compliment each other very well. I kept the body the default font as it ties in well            with my idea of a simple website.
     * ## Colour Palette
     Using the [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) website to generate a colour palette, I decided to use a simple theme throughout my website so that I didn't                overload the user's visual senses. I decided to slightly change the colour tones of some of the colour palette suggestions so that they blended better together. I      used  the colour palette more as a guide to further ideas.
     * ## Favicon 
     Using [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) to generate a favicon image for my website, I managed to give it a simple feel that matches the fung shui and vibe of the      whole website. Using the same colours I used in my logo, it really blends everything very well.
    * ## Imagery
    All imagery was sourced from the website, [Pexels.](https://www.pexels.com/)
   
    The images I've chosen in my website give a nice and professional look, whilst also keeping the website nice and simple. All images that are next to accompanying text     have a connection to them, which aids the user in better understanding the purpose of the website. The simple look of the website works well with the massive hero     image in the landing section that is meant to attract the users attention.
    * ## Logo
    The Devkota Consultancy logo was generated from the website  [my free logo maker.](https://myfreelogomaker.com/onboarding)
   
    To keep up with the professional and simple look of my website, my logo is very simple and just has the colour black with a basic engineering image to the left of     the text. 
   
* ## Implemented Features 
  * Navigation bar - This is at the top of the page, consisting of the About, Services and Contact section. When any of these sections are hovered over, a 1px solid #777777 line is shown to showcase to the user that they're about to navigate towards that section of the page. The background of the navbar is white which works well with the #555555 colour of the logo. The navbar is fully functional at smaller screen sizes for mobile users as well.

  * Landing page - Containing the hero image, which covers the majority of the screen to grab the user's attention, and hero text which prompts the user to explore further into the website. The text has the company's name, a summary of what the company does and an option to invite the user to explore the website with a "click here to get started!" section. When this section is clicked, the user is directed to the services section which is designed to showcase all the services offered by the company.

  * About us - Containing 2 paragraph sections and 2 image sections, this part of the website introduces the user to the company. The two images featured are of chemical engineers and a chemical engineering plant unit item. Both images are relevant to the text and help the user in gaining a deeper understanding of the company. When about is selected on the navigation bar, this section will appear. 
   
  ![About](documents/about-us.png)
  
  * Further about - The further about section consists of an image with text below it. The reason I've added a further about section is to re-inforce trust with the client by showcasing that this comapny has a many years experience within the industry and therefore can be trusted. In addition to this, by including the company's quality guarantee, it showcases to the client that we take quality VERY seriously. The image is meant to represent a fictional person, partaking in a fictional project for our fictional consultancy.

  * Spacer image - The purpose of the spacer image is to create a break between the about section and the services section. In additon to this, the image is also meant to make the website more visually appealing so that it's not too simple, thus helping it to not be perceived as boring.

  * COVID banner - In light of the new COVID-19 variant recently, I have added the banner in order to showcase to clients that we care about them, but also to bring the website to life to give the vibe that it's real.

  * Services - The services section consists of the comapnies logo with text outlining what services are on offer. Since chemical engineering services vary with the type of project, an exact pricing list isn't used. Instead a pricing report is created by booking an appointment with the design team. When services is selected on the navigation bar, this section will appear.

  * Contact form - The contact form allows the user to book an appointment by submitting their contact details in; the user can also add how they heard about the company. Furthermore, there is a section which allows the user to add input into the form to convey messages to the design team. This allows the design team to get a sense of what services the user requires and gives them a chance to prepare documents before the appointment with the client.
